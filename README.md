# Password Generator

## Purpose
A website that allows a user to generate a password composed of between 8-128 characters, and their choice of up to 4 types of characters: uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols. 

## Built With;
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript

## Bugs
* The prompts begin before user can initiate with the generate password button.

* If user inputs a number outside of the specified range, or a letter/word, the code continues to run instead of restarting the length prompt, and will not generate a password in the end.

* After a password is generated, the user must refresh the webpage in order to generate a new password. The generate password button should initiate this process, but instead will run through the code and not produce a password, even with correct inputs.
